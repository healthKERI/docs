Follow these steps to install and run our tutorials on your operating system:


### Download and Install

**Step 1**: Install Locksmith:

Locksmith is our [KERI](/essentials/overview) identity wallet and secure web proxy.  We currently only have an installable version for macOS (arm64) PCs.  To use any other operating system, you can download our Python Wheel and install as described below

(Other native installers will be available shortly.).

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="macOS">
        ```bash Shell
        curl -s -L -o locksmith.dmg https://healthkeri-deployment.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/locksmith/v0.0.1/MacOS/Locksmith.dmg
        ```

        Or you can download [Locksmith](https://healthkeri-deployment.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/locksmith/v0.0.1/MacOS/Locksmith.dmg) directly.

        Locate `locksmith.dmg in Finder, double click and drag the Locksmith Icon into Applications folder.
        <img
            className="block"
            src="/images/locksmith-install.png"
            alt="Locksmith"
        />

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Python">
        If you are using an operation system other than macOS, you need to use the correct version of Python specified [here](/environment):

      ```bash Shell
      python -m venv ./locksmith
      source ./locksmith/bin/activate
      curl -s -L -o rack-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl https://healthkeri-deployment.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/rack/rack-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
      curl -s -L -o Locksmith-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl https://healthkeri-deployment.sfo3.digitaloceanspaces.com/locksmith/v0.0.1/Locksmith-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
      pip install rack-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
      pip install Locksmith-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
      ```

        <Info>**Recommended:** We recommend using a unique Python virtual environment as detailed above.</Info>
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Step 2**: Clone the healthKERI [rack-docker](https://github.com/healthKERI/rack-docker) repository:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Git
git clone https://github.com/healthKERI/rack-docker.git
cd rack-docker
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
    **Note**: Please see this [Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.13/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) for using GitHub Desktop instead of the command line. <br />
</Note>



### Launching Locksmith

If you downloaded one of our native installers for [Locksmith](#download-and-install) please use your Operating System to find and launch the application.

If you installed the Python wheel in a virtual machine, you can launch Locksmith with the following command:

```bash
source ${PATH_TO_VENV}/bin/activate
lockmsith
```

Locksmith will attempt to create database files in one of two directories.  If you have a directory named `/usr/local/var/keri` and the current user has write access to that directory it will create all database files and keystores at that location.
Otherwise, it will create and use a directory named `.keri` in the current user's home directory.  If you want to back up your KERI identity information and your keystore, you can back up which ever of these two directories is created on your device.


For more information see the [KERI Python Reference Implementation](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy).
